# string manipulation
```{r}
string_vec=c("my","name", "is", "kelly")

str_detect(string_vec, "m")
```

```{r}
str_replace(string_vec, "m", "M")
```


str_detect means detecting a pattern inside a string 
there are a lot of "str_ " functions, and you can scroll through to see which ones exist in which. 

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^i think") #starts with i think
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$") #ends with i think
```
starts with "i think" and which ones ends with "i think"
the ^ at the beginning means its the start of the string variable.
